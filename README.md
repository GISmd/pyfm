# Possible objectives

The goal of this project is to build a simple python tool that would allow one to look-up a user's listening habits. A good starting place for this would be by album or by track. There should be an easy way to search for artists, ablums, and tracks and view user's scrobbles of the tracks therein.

## Playlists - Chronological Playlists

Make a playlist creator wherein you select an artist (or list of artists) and the creator will make a playlist in order of the album's release dates (this becomes problematic when there are deluxe editions, collections, etc...). Allow the user to select EPs or Full Lengths or both.
